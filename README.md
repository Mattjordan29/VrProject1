In this project I was tasked with creating my dream room using virtual reality software. I chose to make a small apartment style living space consisting of a bedroom, living area, and kitchen. The house has modern aesthetic consisting of hardwood floors, a dark slate tiling on the walls and a brick accent wall separating the bedroom from living room. To decorate the house, I used a verity of items while still trying to maintain the theme. I furnished the kitchen with a stove, oven and cabinet as well as created my own island for the kitchen. The living room has a sofa, coffee table, tv stand as well as tv. The bedroom is decorated with a bed, bookshelf, desk, desk chair and painting. Throughout the house you will find some particular items such as a futuristic rifle and tank as well as the logo for the video game overwatch. I included these items to add personalization to the house. The house also includes interactive features such as a swinging door, light controls and upon clicking on the Overwatch logo you will hear the Overwatch opening theme. You will be able to observe all of these interaction in the video linked above as well as the photo album in the main branch.
